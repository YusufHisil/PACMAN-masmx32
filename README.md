# Simple Pacman Clone

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pacman game, developed in MASM x32 assembly language.
It utilizes a custom canvas library included in the project folder for rendering the game graphics.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate through the maze, eat dots, and avoid ghosts to score points.
- **Power-Ups**: Consume power-ups to temporarily eat ghosts and earn extra points.
- **Lives**: The player starts with three lives. Coming into contact with a ghost without having consumed a power-up results in a loss of life.
- **Simple Controls**: Use the WASD keys to control Pacman's movement through the maze.
- **Custom Canvas Library**: A specially designed canvas library for rendering graphics in MASM x32.
